# MongoDB

Welcome to our MongoDB e-book!

This short e-book is here to help answer questions related to installation and usage of MongoDB in your operating system.

Use the sidebar to navigate to the sections relevant to your operating system for more information.

There is also a section on using MongoDB with Python, which helps review what's covered in the course. If you encounter errors when working with MongoDB, the [FAQ](/mongodb_with_python/faq.html#nonetype-has-no-attribute) page in that section might also be helpful!
