# Installation and Usage

## Installation

If you are wanting to work with MongoDB for local development (e.g. to follow our Complete Python Web Course), I recommend you download the MongoDB Community Server.

You can find it here: [https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

Select the latest version, your operating system, and what type of package you want (the default is fine if you're not sure which one to go for!).

## Usage

Once MongoDB has been installed, it gives you two main things:

* `mongo`; and
* `mongod`.

These are programs you can run in your console (`Terminal.app`). Running `mongod` will start up the MongoDB server. Running `mongo` will launch a MongoDB console that connects to that server and lets you run queries.

::: warning
Remember to run the `mongod` program first, otherwise `mongo` has nothing to connect to!
